# EDP Stages

Get acquainted with EDP CI/CD workflow and stages description.

## EDP CI/CD Workflow
Within EDP, the pipeline framework comprises the following pipelines:

* Code Review;
* Build;
* Deploy.

_**NOTE**: Please refer to the [EDP Pipeline Framework](https://github.com/epam/edp-admin-console/blob/master/documentation/cicd_customization/edp_pipeline_framework.md) page for details._

The diagram below shows the commit path through these pipelines and the respective stages.

## Stages Description

The table below provides the details on all the stages in the EDP pipeline framework:
